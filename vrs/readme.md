This Project gives you a Server-Client-App to mirror your Computer-Screen to your Phone or 3D-Glasses.

Just upload it to your Web-Page and start the index.html in your browser.
Apply the settings and start the stream.

Open the r.html on your target-device with the session-code (or just scan the QR-Code).
Apply the display-settings as you like and cycle through the 8 different styles until it 
matches your glasses.

If it does not worky propperly, just reload the pages and try again.

Enjoy.
